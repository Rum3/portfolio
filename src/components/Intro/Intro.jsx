          I started coding during the first COVID19 quarantine â€“ it was
           like a joke for me. I had plenty of free time and I watched a 
           single self-study video connected with HTML and CSS. I really 
           enjoyed the process and the final result was indeed satisfying 
           for me. After only an hour of watching a self-study video I was 
           able to create a website and this inspired me to continue further. 
           I kept watching more and more videos and my interest was constantly 
           increasing.  A time had come and I understood that I cannot self-educate
            myself anymore, that is why I decided to participate in JavaScript course 
            and then in another React course. However, I am absolutely sure that there 
            is plenty more things that I will thrive but the best feature that I own is my
             passion for gaining new knowledge and developing my professional skills.
